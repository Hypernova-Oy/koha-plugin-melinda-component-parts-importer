# Koha plugin - Melinda Component Part Records Importer

This plugin searches Melinda for component part records and stages them
for import in Koha.

Melinda search is performed using host record's 001 field and Melinda's
melinda.partsofhost search index.

## How it looks

### Quick import

Quick import using selected MARC framework and the default matcher configured
in plugin settings.

### Staged MARC records and manual batch import

Staging lets you use Koha's "Manage staged MARC records" tool to import the records.
